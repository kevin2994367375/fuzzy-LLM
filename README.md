# Fuzzy-LLM: An Framework for Bearing Fault Diagnosis

Our work introduces FuzzyLLM, a novel framework that bridges the gap between the numerical world of sensor data and the semantic reasoning space of Large Language Models (LLMs). By constructing fuzzy knowledgeâ€”including semantic feature descriptions and uncertainty-aware soft labelsâ€”we enhance the diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and robustness of LLMs for industrial fault diagnosis tasks.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

It is highly recommended to use a Conda environment to manage dependencies.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin2994367375/fuzzy-LLM.git
cd FuzzyLLM
```
**2. Create and activate the Conda environment:**
```bash
conda create -n fuzzyllm python=3.10
conda activate fuzzyllm
```
**3. Install PyTorch with GPU support:**
Visit the official PyTorch website to get the correct installation command for your specific CUDA version. For example:
```bash
# Example for CUDA 12.1
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
**4. Install all other dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**5. Download Models (Optional but Recommended):**
To avoid repeated downloads, you can pre-download the language models you intend to use and place them in a ./models/ directory. For gated models like Llama-3 or Gemma, you must first request access on their respective Hugging Face pages and log in via the terminal:
Generated bash
huggingface-cli login
Use code with caution.
